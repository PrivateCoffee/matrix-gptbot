# Will send error tracebacks to you (= Operator above) if an error occurs processing a message from you
# Defaults to 0 (= off)

# The default room name used by the !newroom command
# Defaults to GPTBot if not set
#
# DefaultRoomName = GPTBot

# Contents of a special message sent to the GPT API with every request.
# Can be used to give the bot some context about the environment it's running in
#
# SystemMessage = You are a helpful bot.

# Force inclusion of the SystemMessage defined above if one is defined on per-room level
# If no custom message is defined for the room, SystemMessage is always included

# ForceSystemMessage = 0

# Path to a custom logo
# Used as room/space image and profile picture
# Defaults to logo.png in assets directory

# Display name for the bot

[OpenAI]

# The Chat Completion model you want to use.

# Unless you are in the GPT-4 beta (if you don't know - you aren't),

# Your OpenAI API key
#
# Find this in your OpenAI account:
# https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys 
#
APIKey = sk-yoursecretkey

# The maximum amount of input sent to the API
# 
# In conjunction with MaxMessage, this determines how much context (= previous 
# messages) you can send with your query.
#
# If you set this too high, the responses you receive will become shorter the 
# longer the conversation gets.
#
# https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them
#
# MaxTokens = 3000

# The maximum number of messages in the room that will be considered as context
#
# By default, the last (up to) 20 messages will be sent as context, in addition
# to the system message and the current query itself.
#
# MaxMessages = 20

# The base URL of the OpenAI API
#
# Setting this allows you to use a self-hosted AI model for chat completions
# using something like https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python
#
# BaseURL = https://openai.local/v1

# Whether to force the use of tools in the chat completion model
#
# Currently, only gpt-3.5-turbo supports tools. If you set this to 1, the bot
# will use that model for tools even if you have a different model set as the
# default. It will only generate the final result using the default model.
#
# ForceTools = 0
